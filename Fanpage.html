    <h3>Bio</h3>

    <p>The Doors are an American Rock band from the late 1960's & 70's, led by lead singer Jim Morrison. Morrison's poetic lyrics combined with mesmerizing sound created from Manzarek's keyboard helped spur The Doors to being one of the most successful bands of its generation.<br><br>The Doors with Morrison released six albums in five years, some of which are considered among the greatest of all time, including Strange Days (1967), and L.A. Woman (1971). They were one of the most successful bands during that time and by 1972 the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8 million singles.</p>
